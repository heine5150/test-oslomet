            Professionals interviewing maltreated children supported via
            artificial avatars

          The project proposes to develop a new digital interview-training
          program drawing on expertise in developmental psychology and
          artificial intelligence
        </p>

        <p>
          Prevention of maltreatment, physical and sexual abuse of children is a
          significant societal problem and a politically prioritized task. Abuse
          and maltreatment increase the risk for severe psychological,
          psychosocial and somatic health problems. Protecting and assisting
          maltreated children is therefore of high priority for child protective
          services and law enforcement.
        </p>

        <p>
          These cases are demanding, and the quality of the investigative
          interviews conducted by the child protective services and the police
          must be high. However, national and international research show that
          although both intensive and less intensive training programs for
          investigative interviewers may impart knowledge about good practice,
          they have little, if any, effect on the interviewing skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project proposes to develop a new digital interview-training
          program drawing on expertise in developmental psychology and
          artificial intelligence. The program includes an interactive avatar (a
          virtual child) that responds like a real child during an interview
          situation. We will then determine if an interview-training program
          using realistic, interactive avatars can effectively improve to a
          consistently high level, the skills of child-welfare and
          law-enforcement professionals at interviewing maltreated and abused
          children. We will also investigate whether they maintain these skills
          over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project has the potential to contribute to more efficient and
          coordinated assistance to children who are victims of maltreatment,
          violence and sexual abuse. The interactive-learning program, if
          successfully, will thus significantly lower the interviewer-training
          costs. However, first and foremost, the project aims to improve the
          investigative interviewing skills of practitioners tasked with
          protecting vulnerable children, thereby contributing to the prevention
          of child abuse and physical violence.
